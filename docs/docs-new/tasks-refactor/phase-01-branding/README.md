# Phase 1 - Branding & Configuration

## Status: Ready for Implementation

## Tasks: 14 files (Pre-Implementation + Phase 1)

### Overview
This phase includes pre-implementation safety measures and all branding/configuration changes. **Zero database changes** - completely safe and non-destructive.

### Task List

**Pre-Implementation Safety (001-003, 005, 007):**
- task_001.txt - Create Full Database Backup
- task_002.txt - Backup Media Files
- task_003.txt - Create Git Tag ✅ **DONE**
- task_005.txt - Document Rollback Plan
- task_007.txt - Create Branding Context Processor

**Phase 1 Branding (008-015):**
- task_008.txt - Update PWA Manifest
- task_009.txt - Update Logos and Favicons
- task_010.txt - Implement Role-Based Navigation Structure (Cornerstone Task)
- task_012.txt - Update Announcements Template
- task_013.txt - Update Home Page Template
- task_014.txt - Update Page Titles Across Templates
- task_015.txt - Verify Phase 1 Branding Complete

### Key Features

**Pre-Implementation:**
- Database and media backups
- Git safety tag
- Rollback plan documentation
- Context processor with branding variables

**Branding Changes:**
- PWA manifest updated to "Tarbiyyah Management System"
- New logos and favicons
- **5 Role-based navigation bars** (TARBIYYAH_ADMIN, MADRASAH_ADMIN, ASATIDZ, STUDENT, PARENT)
- Updated announcements and home page
- Page titles using template variables

### Dependencies
- None - This is the starting phase
- Can start immediately after stakeholder approval

### Risk Level: VERY LOW
- No database schema changes
- No model modifications
- Only UI/template/static file changes
- Fully reversible via git

### Timeline Estimate
- **Sequential:** 7-11 hours
- **Parallel (3 agents):** 4-5 hours

### Notes
- **All changes are visual only** - no backend modifications
- **Completely safe** to implement first
- **Immediate visible results** after completion
- Sets foundation for role-based navigation in later phases
- See START_HERE.md for parallel execution strategy
