# Task ID: 002
# Title: Backup Media Files and Static Assets
# Status: done
# Dependencies: none
# Priority: high
# Description: Create complete backup of all user-uploaded media files, static assets, and documents before refactoring.

# Details:
Create complete backup of all user-uploaded media files, static assets, and documents before refactoring.

## Implementation Steps:
1. Identify media directories:
   - `ls -la media/`
   - `ls -la static/`
2. Create archive: `tar -czf media_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz media/`
3. Create static backup: `tar -czf static_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz static/`
4. Verify archives:
   - `tar -tzf media_backup_*.tar.gz | wc -l`
5. Upload to cloud storage
6. Keep local copies
7. Document in BACKUP_LOG.md

## Acceptance Criteria:
- All files in MEDIA_ROOT are backed up
- All static files are backed up
- User profile images backed up
- Document uploads (certificates, transcripts) backed up
- Backup verified (file count matches)
- Backup stored in 2+ locations
- Backup compressed to save space

## Files Modified:
- `media_backup_YYYYMMDD.tar.gz`
- `static_backup_YYYYMMDD.tar.gz`
- `BACKUP_LOG.md`

## Important Notes:
- Check available disk space before creating archives
- Large media directories may take significant time
- Consider using rsync for incremental backups
- Estimate: 15-30 minutes

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify backup file exists and has reasonable size
2. Restore on test database to verify integrity
3. Confirm all tables present in restored database
4. Compare row counts with original database
