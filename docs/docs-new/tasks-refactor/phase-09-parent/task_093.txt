# Details:
Create new Django app for parent portal functionality. This app will handle parent-student relationships, parent dashboard, and parent-specific features for the Tarbiyyah Management System.

## Implementation Steps:
1. Create parent portal app:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/saidamenmambayao/apps/madaris-ms/src/apps
   python ../manage.py startapp parents
   ```
2. Add to INSTALLED_APPS in settings:
   ```python
   # config/settings/base.py
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       ...
       'apps.academics',
       'apps.parents',  # New app
       ...
   ]
   ```
3. Create __init__.py and apps.py:
   ```python
   # apps/parents/apps.py
   from django.apps import AppConfig

   class ParentsConfig(AppConfig):
       default_auto_field = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'
       name = 'apps.parents'
       verbose_name = 'Parent Portal'
   ```
4. Create initial directory structure:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /Users/saidamenmambayao/apps/madaris-ms/src/apps/parents/templates/parents
   mkdir -p /Users/saidamenmambayao/apps/madaris-ms/src/apps/parents/static/parents
   ```
5. Run initial migration:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/saidamenmambayao/apps/madaris-ms
   python manage.py makemigrations parents
   python manage.py migrate parents
   ```
6. Verify app is registered in Django admin

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Parent portal app created in apps directory
- App added to INSTALLED_APPS in settings
- Basic app structure verified (models, views, admin, urls)
- Initial migration created and applied
- App accessible and registered in Django admin

## Files Modified:
- `src/apps/parents/ (new directory)`
- `src/apps/parents/__init__.py`
- `src/apps/parents/apps.py`
- `src/apps/parents/models.py`
- `src/apps/parents/admin.py`
- `src/apps/parents/views.py`
- `src/apps/parents/urls.py`
- `src/apps/parents/templates/parents/ (new directory)`
- `src/apps/parents/static/parents/ (new directory)`
- `src/config/settings/base.py`

## Important Notes:
- App name is 'parents' following Django conventions
- Will be referred to as 'Parent Portal' in UI
- Template and static directories follow Django best practices
- Estimate: 20 minutes

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify app appears in INSTALLED_APPS
2. Run migrations successfully
3. Import app models without errors
4. Verify app shows in Django admin
