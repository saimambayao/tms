# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 015
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up Next.js 15 with React 19 and TypeScript and Tailwind CSS as the frontend layer for TMS. Keep implementation minimal and focused.

# Details:
Set up Next.js 15 with React 19 and TypeScript and Tailwind CSS as the frontend layer for TMS. Keep implementation minimal and focused.

## Implementation Steps:
1. Create Next.js project:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/saidamenmambayao/apps/madaris-ms/
   npx create-next-app@latest frontend --typescript --tailwind --app
   ```
2. Configure environment variables:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1" > .env.local
   ```
3. Install additional dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install axios swr next-pwa
   ```
4. Create basic folder structure:
   ```
   frontend/
   ├── app/
   ├── components/
   ├── lib/
   ├── public/
   └── types/
   ```
5. Configure next.config.js for PWA
6. Test dev server: `npm run dev`

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Next.js 15 with React 19 project initialized with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS configured (maintain existing design)
- Environment variables configured for Django API connection
- Basic project structure created
- PWA configuration added
- Dev server runs successfully

## Files Modified:
- `NEW: /Users/saidamenmambayao/apps/madaris-ms/frontend/ (entire directory)`
- `NEW: frontend/next.config.js`
- `NEW: frontend/tailwind.config.js`
- `NEW: frontend/.env.local`

## Important Notes:
- Minimal setup - just foundation
- Keep configuration simple
- Tailwind CSS ensures design consistency
- Estimate: 30 minutes

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify all acceptance criteria are met
2. Test the implemented functionality
3. Verify no regressions in related features
4. Confirm all files were properly modified
