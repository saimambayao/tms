1. Add curriculum fields:
   ```python
   class Madrasah(models.Model):
       ...
       # Curriculum Offered
       offers_arabic_language = BooleanField(default=True)
       offers_quran_studies = BooleanField(default=True)
       offers_hadith_studies = BooleanField(default=True, help_text="Ilm al-Hadith")
       offers_islamic_studies = BooleanField(default=True)
       offers_general_education = BooleanField(
           default=False,
           help_text="Secular subjects (Math, Science, etc.)"
       )
   ```
2. Create migration
3. Test filtering in admin by curriculum type

## Acceptance Criteria:

2. Test the implemented functionality
3. Verify no regressions in related features
4. Confirm all files were properly modified
