# Details:
Create the basic Django app structure for the curriculum management system. This app will handle subjects, curriculum frameworks, and lesson plans for the Tarbiyyah Management System.

## Implementation Steps:
1. Create the curriculum app:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/saidamenmambayao/apps/madaris-ms/src
   python manage.py startapp curriculum
   ```

2. Move app to apps directory:
   ```bash
   mv curriculum apps/
   ```

3. Update apps/curriculum/apps.py:
   ```python
   from django.apps import AppConfig

   class CurriculumConfig(AppConfig):
       default_auto_field = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'
       name = 'apps.curriculum'
       verbose_name = 'Curriculum Management'

       def ready(self):
           """Import signals when app is ready."""
           pass  # Import signals here when needed
   ```

4. Create necessary subdirectories:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/saidamenmambayao/apps/madaris-ms/src/apps/curriculum
   mkdir -p templates/curriculum
   mkdir -p static/curriculum/css
   mkdir -p static/curriculum/js
   mkdir -p migrations
   ```

5. Add app to INSTALLED_APPS in src/config/settings/base.py:
   ```python
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       # ... existing apps ...
       'apps.madaris',
       'apps.teachers',
       'apps.curriculum',  # New app
       # ... rest of apps ...
   ]
   ```

6. Create initial __init__.py file in apps/curriculum/:
   ```python
   # apps/curriculum/__init__.py
   """
   Curriculum Management App

   Handles subjects, curriculum frameworks, and lesson plans
   for madaris in the Tarbiyyah Management System.
   """
   default_app_config = 'apps.curriculum.apps.CurriculumConfig'
   ```

7. Verify app is recognized:
   ```bash
   python manage.py check curriculum
   ```

8. Create initial migration (empty):
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations curriculum
   ```

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Curriculum app created with proper Django structure
- App registered in INSTALLED_APPS
- Basic __init__.py files present
- Apps.py configured with proper verbose name
- Directory structure follows Django conventions
- App accessible in Django admin (empty for now)

## Files Modified:
- `apps/curriculum/ (new directory)`
- `apps/curriculum/__init__.py (new file)`
- `apps/curriculum/apps.py (new file)`
- `apps/curriculum/models.py (new file - empty for now)`
- `apps/curriculum/admin.py (new file - empty for now)`
- `apps/curriculum/views.py (new file - empty for now)`
- `apps/curriculum/urls.py (new file)`
- `apps/curriculum/forms.py (new file)`
- `apps/curriculum/tests.py (new file)`
- `src/config/settings/base.py (update)`

## Important Notes:
- This task only creates the app structure, no models yet
- Models will be added in subsequent tasks
- Follow Django best practices for app organization
- Estimate: 30 minutes

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify app appears in INSTALLED_APPS
2. Run migrations successfully
3. Import app models without errors
4. Verify app shows in Django admin
5. Review planning documentation
6. Verify all risks identified
7. Confirm rollback procedures documented
8. Ensure dependencies are mapped
