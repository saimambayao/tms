# Task ID: 012
# Title: Update Core Announcement Categories
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 007
# Priority: high
# Description: Update announcement categories in apps/core/models.py to reflect Tarbiyyah/education context instead of parliamentary context.

# Details:
Update announcement categories in apps/core/models.py to reflect Tarbiyyah/education context instead of parliamentary context.

## Implementation Steps:
1. Open core models file:
   ```bash
   code /Users/saidamenmambayao/apps/madaris-ms/src/apps/core/models.py
   ```
2. Update Announcement.Category choices:
   ```python
   class Category(models.TextChoices):
       GENERAL = 'general', 'General Announcement'
       ACADEMIC = 'academic', 'Academic Notice'
       ENROLLMENT = 'enrollment', 'Enrollment/Registration'
       EXAM = 'exam', 'Examination Notice'
       EVENT = 'event', 'School Event'
       HOLIDAY = 'holiday', 'Holiday/Break Notice'
       EMERGENCY = 'emergency', 'Emergency Alert'
       MAINTENANCE = 'maintenance', 'System Maintenance'
       TRAINING = 'training', 'Teacher Training'
       ACCREDITATION = 'accreditation', 'Accreditation Notice'  # Accreditation by MBHTE
   ```
3. Create migration:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/saidamenmambayao/apps/madaris-ms
   python manage.py makemigrations core
   ```
4. Review migration file (should be data-safe, only adding choices)
5. Apply migration to staging database first:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate core --database=staging
   ```
6. Test in Django admin - create announcement with new category
7. Verify existing announcements still display correctly

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Announcement model located in core app
- Category choices updated with education-relevant options
- Migration file created for category changes
- Existing announcements remain functional
- New categories available in admin interface
- Test creating announcement with new categories

## Files Modified:
- `src/apps/core/models.py`
- `src/apps/core/migrations/000X_update_announcement_categories.py`

## Important Notes:
- Keep 'general' category for backward compatibility
- Old category values remain valid (no data migration needed)
- New categories are additive only
- ACCREDITATION category is for announcements about accreditation by MBHTE (Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education)
- Tarbiyyah Committee coordinates accreditation process and makes announcements
- Estimate: 30 minutes

# Test Strategy:
1. Run migrations and verify schema changes
2. Create test instances to verify new fields
3. Test admin interface with new fields
4. Verify backward compatibility with existing data
5. Verify app appears in INSTALLED_APPS
6. Run migrations successfully
7. Import app models without errors
8. Verify app shows in Django admin
