# Details:
Update Progressive Web App (PWA) manifest.json file to reflect Tarbiyyah Management System branding, replacing BM Parliament references.

## Implementation Steps:
1. Locate manifest.json file:
   ```bash
   find /Users/saidamenmambayao/apps/madaris-ms -name "manifest.json"
   ```
2. Backup original manifest:
   ```bash
   cp manifest.json manifest.json.backup
   ```
3. Update manifest.json:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Tarbiyyah Management System",
     "short_name": "TMS",
     "description": "Islamic Education Management System for BARMM Madaris",
     "start_url": "/",
     "display": "standalone",
     "background_color": "#ffffff",
     "theme_color": "#047857",
     "icons": [
       ...existing icons...
     ]
   }
   ```
4. Clear browser cache and test PWA installation
5. Verify manifest loads correctly: `/manifest.json`

## Acceptance Criteria:
- manifest.json file located and backed up
- name field updated to "Tarbiyyah Management System"
- short_name updated to "TMS"
- description updated to reflect Islamic education focus
- theme_color and background_color updated if needed
- App installs correctly on mobile devices with new name
- Test PWA installation on iOS and Android

## Files Modified:
- `src/static/manifest.json (or templates/manifest.json)`
- `manifest.json.backup (new backup file)`

## Important Notes:
- Manifest affects how app appears when installed on home screen
- Keep existing icon paths unless logos are also updated
- Test on both iOS Safari and Chrome Android
- Estimate: 20 minutes

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify app appears in INSTALLED_APPS
2. Run migrations successfully
3. Import app models without errors
4. Verify app shows in Django admin
