# Details:
Create new Django app for teacher/asatidz management with TeacherProfile model extending User.

## Implementation Steps:
1. Create teachers app:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/saidamenmambayao/apps/madaris-ms/src/apps
   python ../manage.py startapp teachers
   ```
2. Add to INSTALLED_APPS in settings:
   ```python
   # config/settings/base.py
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       ...
       'apps.chapters',
       'apps.teachers',  # New app
       ...
   ]
   ```
3. Create __init__.py files:
   ```bash
   touch /Users/saidamenmambayao/apps/madaris-ms/src/apps/teachers/__init__.py
   ```
4. Run initial migration:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations teachers
   python manage.py migrate teachers
   ```
5. Verify in Django admin

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Teachers app created
- App added to INSTALLED_APPS
- Basic app structure verified
- Initial migration created
- App accessible in admin

## Files Modified:
- `src/apps/teachers/ (new directory)`

- `src/apps/teachers/admin.py`
- `src/apps/teachers/views.py`
